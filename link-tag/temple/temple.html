        <big><b >Badarinath or Badarinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to
            Vishnu. It is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand,
            India. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to
            Vishnu—holy shrines for Vaishnavas—who is worshipped as Badrinath.
            It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and
            the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in
            the Himalayan region. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks
            in Chamoli district along the banks of Alaknanda River. It is one of
            the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 2.8
            million (28 lakh) visits in just 2 months in 2022.[1] It is one of
            the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.</b ></big >

        <big><b >The Somanath temple (IAST: somanātha) or Deo Patan, is a Hindu
            temple located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is
            one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is the first
            among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.[1] It is unclear when
            the first version of the Somnath temple was built, with estimates
            varying between the early centuries of the 1st millennium and about
            the 9th century CE.[2][3] The temple is not mentioned in the ancient
            Sanskrit texts of Hinduism; while various texts, including the
            Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana, mention a tirtha (pilgrimage site)
            at Prabhas Patan on the coastline of Saurashtra, where the temple is
            presently located, there is no evidence that a temple existed at the
            site in ancient times.</b></big>
