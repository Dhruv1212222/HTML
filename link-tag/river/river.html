        <b >The Alaknanda is a turbulent Himalayan river in the Indian state of
            Uttarakhand and one of the two headstreams of the Ganges, the major
            river of Northern India and a river considered holy in Hinduism. In
            hydrology, the Alaknanda is considered the source stream of the
            Ganges on account of its greater length and discharge;[1] while, in
            Hindu tradition and culture, the other headstream, the Bhagirathi,
            is considered the source stream.</b ></big >

        <big><b>The Ganges is a lifeline to tens of millions of people who live in
            its basin and depend on it for their daily needs.[13] It has been
            important historically, with many former provincial or imperial
            capitals such as Pataliputra,[14] Kannauj,[14] Sonargaon, Dhaka,
            Bikrampur, Kara, Munger, Kashi, Patna, Hajipur, Delhi, Bhagalpur,
            Murshidabad, Baharampur, Kampilya, and Kolkata located on its banks
            or the banks of tributaries and connected waterways. The river is
            home to approximately 140 species of fish, 90 species of amphibians,
            and also reptiles and mammals, including critically endangered
            species such as the gharial and South Asian river dolphin.[15] The
            Ganges is the most sacred river to Hindus.[16] It is worshipped as
            the goddess Ganga in Hinduism.</b ></big >
